#### Overview
Grasshopper provides a software environment for rapid scripting and design computation. This environment offers an extremely flexible, visual approach to programming. Impala replicates common **bottleneck Grasshopper operations with a focus on efficiency**, allowing complex scripts and static simulations embedded within Grasshopper to make use of all available computational capacity. This is primarily evident in scripts that deal with thousands of objects or rely heavily on **physically-based information and computation**. 

The primary target audience is experienced design computation practitioners and Grasshopper users who are running into the upper bounds of the tool's native, single-core performance, and are willing to take a finer approach to boosting performance at key points. Impala focuses primarily on replicating existing Grasshopper functionality and developing an environment suitable to seamless integration of performant or multithreaded computation within GH. To this end it currently contains three types of components:

- Components that perform identical (or nearly identical) operations to existing Grasshopper components, but do so using a parallel strategy or a better algorithmic complexity (ex: `Closest Point`, `Halton`)
- Components that condense expensive Grasshopper patterns and use imperative methods to significantly reduce the time and space needed to obtain a result (ex: `Closest Curve Closest Point`, `MeshFlow`)
- Components that limit Grasshopper's type-casting system in exchange for performance gains on larger inputs (ex: the `QuickMath` components)

Additionally, performance is improved relative to native GH by exposing "threshold" parameters wherever possible - allowing the user to specify under which conditions they do not want the result of an operation, significantly speeding up the computation in these cases.
	

**Impala is not yet fully tested or ready for release. See Development Milestone (v1.0) for current progress.**

#### Architecture

Impala adapts Grasshopper's default logic for operating on multiple trees simultaneously. The primary goal is to extend Grasshopper's capabilities (by allowing a wider range of expensive operations) while maintaining the flexibility that GH's associative model lends to designers within C# code. 

Impala provides a series of public, generic methods that operate on various combinations of `GH_Structure<T>` and provide standard and parallel functional operations (Map, Zip, Reduce, etc.) with integrated, **user-defined error checking operations**. These are part of the static class `Impala.Generated` and can be used in any other projects by referencing `Impala.dll` from a `GH_Component` implementation. They are parameterically defined and generated methods, and aim to cover all possible input-output and reduction/expansion combinations ((1 -> 1), (1 -> N), (N -> 1)) with all combinations of inputs on both ends. 

Several components also make use of **granularity control**, and tuning this dynamically is a focus of future development. 
	
A set of test files and extensive benchmarking results provide examples (and, where applicable, guarantees of correctness against an equivalent native GH baseline implementation) for all Impala components, as well as a short set of analysis notes for each of them specifying the best use-cases.

#### Compatibility

- Impala is compatible with Rhinoceros 5 (SR 14), Grasshopper 0.9.0076 and later. Current tests using Rhino 6 and GH 1 indicate no break in functionality.
- Impala uses the latest point-release of C# (7.3 at the time of writing) and is compiled with Visual Studio 2017 on Windows only. 

---
#### Benchmarks

- Current benchmarks are available in `/bench`, and are generated primarily using `bencher.gh`. Standalone benchmark files are also used to test for correctness - a typical benchmark will verify correctness and measure performance against the equivalent native implementation to the Impala functionality. For example, a section of the QuickMath benchmark might look like this:

- Preliminary benchmarks indicate that Impala components are as fast as native GH for all input sizes, and significantly faster for any larger input size. Additionally, Impala components are as fast or faster than the multithreaded GH components in GH1. Unlike those components, however, Impala components are optimised against adversarial input patterns, and can significantly outperform the multithreaded GH1 components in many cases:

#### Moving Forward

Additional goals for future development include:
* Composition of other expensive operations (occlusion, graph traversals, large scale collisions)
* Automated integration of several Impala components in the form of a macro that searches for locations in a script where Impala could improve GH functionality and substituting the analogous component
* Allowing inter-component parallelism within a group. By maintaining constant inputs and outputs in a group of components, their operation set can be run in parallel, making use of Grasshopper's already visually-explicit dependency graph to structure the computation. This can speed up definitions that don't have a large-operation bottleneck, but may have to perform multiple disjoint sets of computations.
